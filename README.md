Blood Pressure Machine Learning App
The Machine Learning Blood Pressure Risk Assessor is a tool that will predict if a patient is at risk of developing high blood pressure with three simple feature vectors: Heart Rate, Heart Rate Regularity, and Cuff Size. It can quickly screen patients for further testing with just the application and a measuring tape. It is a proof of concept that shows how we can draw conclusions from a few feature vectors with machine learning and apply that to personalize healthcare.
Please note this was not made under the care of health professionals and is meant to be an exersize in machine learning. If you believe you are at risk of high blood pressure please consult with your physcian.
